I decided that in 2014, I’d push all the silly excuses aside and give public speaking a shot. To my excitement, my first talk proposal about techniques for sketchnoting technical content has been accepted to two conferences year! I wanted to share my experience crafting and submitting a proposal.</p><h2>Step 1: What to Talk About</h2><p>The very hardest part of the process, the part that has the potential to stop everything in its tracks, is deciding what to talk about. I started by asking myself some questions: What am I good at? What can I teach people about? What do I think people would be interested in learning about?</p><p>I’m a front end developer, so these questions took me on a meandering path through various ideas about CSS and user experience and structuring app assets, but to be honest, I just couldn’t get excited about any of them. Like I said, this step almost stopped everything in its tracks.</p><p>So I asked myself again why I wanted to speak at all. One of the reasons was pretty simple: some people I knew had encouraged me to. Even more, they’d encouraged me to speak on a specific subject.</p><p>Whenever I go to a conference, I like to practice <a href="http://sketchnotearmy.com/about/">sketchnoting</a>. It turns out to be a great conversation starter—people like looking at them and asking me questions. I get so many questions, in fact, that it occurred to me that I could answer these questions in a public space.</p><p>While walking home one day from work, I spent 30 minutes having a mental conversation with myself about how to sketchnote. By the end of my walk, I was totally pumped; way more pumped that I was about any of the other ideas I’d been kicking around before. I realized I could <em>really</em> talk about this…and, just like that, I had a topic.</p><h2>Step 2: Writing the Proposal</h2><p>There have been <a href=http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/3/17/what-i-learned-from-reading-429-conference-proposals>a lot</a> of <a href="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/04/07/what-your-conference-proposal-is-missing/">great posts</a> about <a href=http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2014-04-04-crafting-a-conference-talk.html>writing</a> effective <a href=http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2013/08/30/submitting-conference-proposals>proposals</a>. I won’t rehash any of that here—you should read them!</p><p>I was fortunate to have some great coaching from more experienced friends about how to write my proposal. In some cases I didn’t even have to ask; they reached out to me! I’m grateful for the advice I received and I think it really helped me feel more confident when crafting and submitting my talk.</p><p>Writing the abstract actually turned out to be easier for me than I anticipated. I imagined meeting someone in the hallway track at a conference and being told: “I really like your sketchnotes! I wish I knew how do that!” While composing the abstract, I asked myself: “How would I reply to this person?”</p><p>The best advice I got was how to approach the detailed description in a CFP (call for proposals). Being completely new to the proposal process, I wasn’t aware what additional information I should provide to the reviewers. One of my mentors advised:</p><blockquote><p>“Good talks should have a purpose. What is it? Many organizers want to see that. You don&#39;t want that in your abstract as that&#39;s the punchline that they have to show up to hear.”</p></blockquote><p>With that in mind, I tried to keep a few details to myself, but also communicate my excitement about the subject matter. I started with what inspired me to give the talk in the first place, and how I thought my ideas would help attendees.</p><p>A friend also suggested creating an outline of my talk, which I included in the notes to the organizers. I think this helped communicate that I’d thought about the content of my talk beyond a one-paragraph abstract. It also saved me some time later—I then had a skeleton of a talk to start filling in when creating my slides. Perhaps my submission was a bit of overkill, but I don’t regret spending the time to lay out my ideas.</p><p>You can see my original proposal here: <a href=https://gist.github.com/jessabean/f037a962c751b1d8fca6>https://gist.github.com/jessabean/f037a962c751b1d8fca6</a></p><h2>Step 3: Deciding Where to Submit</h2><p>I knew that I wanted to deliver my talk to developers, so when deciding <em>where</em> to submit my talk, I looked for technical conferences. Seeing as how I feel embraced by the Ruby on Rails community, and am familiar with some of its conferences, I decided to start with some Ruby conferences.</p><p>The very first conference I submitted to was <a href="http://2014.scottishrubyconference.com/">Scottish Ruby Conf</a>. I happen to know the conference organizers and that they are committed to creating a diverse and fun program every year. It’s a conference I’ve enjoyed as an attendee in the past and wanted to go back to. I also submitted to <a href="http://railsconf.com/">RailsConf</a>, which is HUGE and terrifying, but also so much fun and well-attended by many amazing people. Again, I knew that the organizers are always looking for something new and fresh, and I have seen some great design-oriented talks there in the past, so I felt like my talk would fit in.</p><p>To my delight, my talk has been accepted to these two conferences! I feel very honored and humbled by this. So many talented people applied for a limited number of speaker slots. I hope I can deliver a talk that will be worth my valuable place on the schedule.</p><p>I can count on one hand the number of conferences I’ve submitted to so far, and I feel fortunate to have been accepted to two of them. During this process, I’ve specifically sought out conferences that not only provide great content, but also a welcoming space for attendees and speakers. I also had in mind conferences that embrace first-time speakers. I’m a total n00b, so if I’m going to speak, I’d rather it be somewhere with a supportive organizing committee that puts as much thought into the people of their conference as the content.</p><p>Some people advise submitting everywhere to increase the odds of getting accepted. I feel more comfortable with my targeted approach; it may mean I submit to and potentially speak at less conferences, but at least I know if I do get accepted, the conference is totally worth the time and effort to travel.</p><h2>Step 4: Putting the Talk Together</h2><p>I started working on my slides about about 2 months before RailsConf. Thankfully I had my outline from my CFP to start from. I used the <a href="http://writer.pro/">Writer Pro</a> app to start adding additional bullet points to each section of my outline, figuring these points would end up as my speaker’s notes in the final presentation.</p><p>Because I’ve been inspired by others’ sketchnotes for a long time, it was fun and relatively easy to find examples to include in my slides. I spent a weekend perusing the internet and saving images to a folder where I kept all the assets for my slides.</p><p>I tried to follow a lot of the guidance that Zach Holman provides on <a href="http://speaking.io/">Speaking.io</a>, especially the section on typography. My slides are set in PT Sans, an extremely legible sans-serif typeface. It’s often used in signage, which is great because I wanted to ensure that users could see my slides from far away.</p><p>At first, I followed my original outline explicitly; I needed to just get content onto slides. Then I moved things around as I determined a better flow for my talk. My final presentation is slightly different than the outline I submitted. I don’t have an explicit story arc, as many speakers have advised, but I think my talk follows the sketchnoting thought process pretty well.</p><h2>Step 5: Profit?</h2><p>At this point, I still haven’t actually delivered my talk to a conference audience. I’ve had many panicky moments over the last month as I struggled to put together my slides and questioned whether I can actually stand up on a stage and say words without throwing up.</p><p>The good news is, I was able to deliver a practice talk to the engineering team at Shopify…and I didn’t throw up!</p><p>Avdi Grimm recently wrote about giving yourself <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2014/04/08/how-to-suck-at-conference-talks/">permission to suck</a>. I think that’s really good advice. At this point, there are a few too many “ums” in my delivery, and the stories aren’t as funny or as exciting as I imagined them to be in my head. But I’m okay with it…my technique will get better over time.</p><p>It’s simultaneously terrifying and exciting to hear people tell me they are looking forward to my talk. I hope I can deliver!</p><footer class=post-footer><time datetime="2014-04-17 00:00:00 -0400" class=post-date>17 April 2014</time> Tagged:<ul class=tags-list><li><a href=/tag/personal>personal</a></li></ul></footer></article></section><footer id=global-footer><ul class=social-links><li><a href=http://github.com/jessabean class=ss-icon>Octocat</a></li><li><a href=http://twitter.com/jessabean class=ss-icon>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeldredge class=ss-icon>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=http://dribbble.com/jessabean class=ss-icon>Dribbble</a></li></ul></footer><script type=text/javascript>var _gauges = _gauges || [];
