A popular web design pattern is to include horizontal lines on either side of a line of text, often in a heading. An example of this style is the subheading treatment in Spotify's [Year in Review]:
{% img post-img /img/assets/2014-01-26/spotify-heading.jpg %}

There are many different ways to accomplish this via CSS. Many [people] before me have [collected examples] for this very issue, but I figured one more couldn&rsquo;t hurt.

For the purposes of this demonstration, I&rsquo;ve left off the vendor prefixes.

## 1: Pseudo-Elements with Nested Span

### HTML

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
</pre>

### CSS

<pre>
<code class="language-css">h1 {
  position: relative;
  text-align: center;
}

h1 span {
  background: #fff;
  padding: 0 15px;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

h1:before {
  background: #ddd;
  content: "";
  display: block;
  height: 1px;
  position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
  width: 100%;
}

h1:before {
  left: 0;
}</code></pre>

[Demo](http://jsfiddle.net/daRch/)

This method uses a pseudo-element to place a 1px high line before the heading. The line takes up 100% of its container. The span then uses a background color and some padding to sit on top of the line, so it *looks* like there are two lines on either side of the heading.


## 2: Inline Block Heading with Container

### HTML

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

### CSS

<pre><code class="language-css">h1 {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0 15px;
  position: relative;
}

h1:before,
h1:after {
  background: #ddd;
  content: "";
  display: block;
  height: 1px;
  position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
  width: 400%;
}

h1:before {
  right: 100%;
}

h1:after {
  left: 100%;
}

.container {
  overflow: hidden;
  text-align: center;
}</code></pre>

[Demo](http://jsfiddle.net/22gHG/)

This method is similar to #1, with a few small differences. The heading has been set to `display: inline-block`, which means it won&rsquo;t take up 100% of its container. That in turn means the pseudo-elements being used for the lines need to be longer if you want them to stretch across the page. I&rsquo;ve used an arbitrary 400% here, but that width would likely need to be adjusted for various container sizes. Lastly, this method assumes you don&rsquo;t mind setting `overflow: hidden` on a container around the headings.

Bonus: This method will work on headings with multiple lines of text.

## 3: Nested Span and Gradient

### HTML

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>

### CSS

<pre><code class="language-css">
h1 {
  background: linear-gradient(top, #fff 0%, #fff 50%, #ddd 50%, #ddd 50.5%, #fff 50.5%, #fff 100%);
}

h1 span {
  background: #fff;
  padding: 0 15px;
}
</code></pre>

[Demo](http://jsfiddle.net/FcJgJ/)

This time, the CSS is much more concise. The heading contains a linear gradient that starts from the top, with color stops right around 50% from the top to create the horizontal line. This technique still requires an extra span with a background color to lie on top, in order to create the illusion of two lines.

## 4: Nested Span and Border

### HTML

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>

### CSS
<pre><code class="language-css">h1 {
    text-align: center;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
    line-height: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

h1 span {
    background: #fff;
    padding: 0 15px;
}
</code></pre>

[Demo](http://jsfiddle.net/j9wpH/)

This method, proposed by CSS Tricks user [@kevinthompson], sets the heading&rsquo;s line height to 0 and gives it a border. Once again, a span with a background color is needed. The line height might give you trouble if you have a long title, but this method is short and sweet for titles that are also short and sweet.

## 5: Table Cell and Gradient

### HTML

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>

### CSS
<pre><code class="language-css">h1 {
  display: table;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 100%;
}

h1:before,
h1:after {
  background-clip: padding;
  background-image: linear-gradient(transparent 49%, #ddd 50%, #ddd 51%, transparent 51%);
  content: "";
  display: table-cell;
  width: 50%;
}

h1:before {
  border-right: 15px solid transparent;
}

h1:after {
  border-left: 15px solid transparent;
}
</code></pre>

[Demo](http://jsfiddle.net/zk27B/1/)

This method, proposed by CSS Tricks user [@kevinthompson], sets the heading&rsquo;s line height to 0 and gives it a border. Once again, a span with a background color is needed. The line height might give you trouble if you have a long title, but this method is short and sweet for titles that are also short and sweet.

## 6: Flexbox

### HTML

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>

### CSS
<pre><code class="language-css">h1 {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center;
  text-align: center;
}
h1:before, h1:after {
  background-color: #ddd;
  content: '\a0';
  flex-grow: 1;
  height: 1px;
  position: relative;
  top: 0.5em;
}
h1:before {
  margin-right:10px;
}
h1:after {
  margin-left:10px;
}</code></pre>

[Demo](http://jsfiddle.net/6PVPB/)

The flexbox example was proposed by [Jonathan Snook]. In it, the heading is defined as a flexbox container with `display: flex`. Additionally, the heading&rsquo;s contents flow left to right with `flex-direction: row` and are horizontally centered with `justify-content: center`.

If you haven&rsquo;t used the flexbox layout on a project before, you should give it a tryâ€”it&rsquo;s pretty neat! Chris Coyier has a [helpful guide] to how it works.

## Summary

As you can see, there are a ton of ways to achieve this little visual trick, and I&rsquo;ve only covered a few. I&rsquo;m partial to the methods that use less markup, so I can keep my HTML free of extra tags that are used only for presentation. Browser support may vary, so you should pick your poison according to your needs.
