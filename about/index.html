<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>I'm a front-end developer who enjoys building user experiences with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I worked at Shopify building the user interface for the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/online">store admin</a> application. Before that, I was at LivingSocial doing front-end development for <a href="http://merchant.livingsocial.com">merchant products</a>.

<p>I recently took a sabbatical to <a href="http://roaming.eldredge.io">travel the world</a>, an experience that illuminated how amazing this world is, and how much I enjoy meeting the people that live in it.</p>

<p>I can talk your ear off about <a href="https://confreaks.tv/presenters/jessica-eldredge">sketchnotes</a>, books, cats, and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jessabean/6345679417/in/set-72157627744111024">Korean food</a>.
