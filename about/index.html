<h1>Hi!</h1>
<p>I'm a web designer and front end developer. I love UX and web development, front end architecture, and riding my refactor tractor through view files and CSS. I studied literature in college before finding a career making internet things; but I still <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5507405-jessabean">love reading</a>.</p>

<p>I can talk your ear off about comic books, wine, cats, and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jessabean/6345679417/in/set-72157627744111024">Korean food</a>. You can often find me with my nose buried in a <a href="http://projeqt.com/jessabean">sketchbook</a> at conferences or meetups.</p>
