  <p>I'm a front-end developer with 10 years of experience building things on the web. I used to work at Shopify, building the UI and styleguide for the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/online">store admin</a>. And before that, I was building <a href="http://merchant.livingsocial.com">merchant products</a> at LivingSocial.</p>

  <p>When I'm away from the computer, I love to <a href="https://projeqt.com/jessabean">sketchnote</a> (so much I gave a <a href="http://confreaks.tv/presenters/jessica-eldredge">talk about it</a> 3 times), <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5507405-jessabean">read</a>, and sometimes do <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/blog/shakespeare-club">both at the same time</a>! I also have serious <a href="http://roaming.eldredge.io">wanderlust</a>.</p>
