  <h1>Hello! I'm Jess Eldredge.</h1>
  <p>I'm an empathetic developer who enjoys building user experiences with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I care deeply about people, and am happiest collaborating with a diverse team of developers, designers, and product owners to build products that will make users—and developers!—happy.</p>

  <p>I agree with Dan Abramov's <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23juniordevforlife&lang=en">#juniordevforlife</a> philosophy. As a lifelong learner, I believe in mentorship and fostering respectful environments for sharing knowledge.</p>

  <p>Currently helping to craft a better media experience at <em>Slate</em> magazine.</p>
